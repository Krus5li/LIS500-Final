Dates (from canvas assignment):
 - 6 Dec. 8am CST – First Iteration Due: All groups make their prototypes of surveys/sites live. *Note: Make sure you incorporate a user feedback form on your Results Page, so that you can get direct feedback from peers taking your early prototype. Why hunt for feedback on Canvas, when you can get it right in your survey itself!  
- Dec. 6 to Dec. 9, 8am CST — All students should take 2 (two) questionnaires and post their feedback to those teams if you find any bugs or have any other initial feedback. These do not have to be "real" responses and are just to get an idea of what everyone else is doing and to test for errors. 
- Dec. 9  to Dec. 13, 8am CST — Groups begin working on their final site/questionnaire iteration; Suggestion, start also working on Individual essays, and some writing on Group Analysis.  
- Dec. 13, 8am CST— Final Iteration goes live. All edits and changes to the Web sites must be made. Any "testing" data in your database table should be cleared out. Make last minute revisions. After this point consider your recorded survey responses (data) as usable and real.
- Dec. 13-16 – Each student should complete (2) two different tests than you completed during Beta week. 
- Dec. 16-20 — Groups prepare your final edits, work on collective and group essays. 
- Dec. 20 8am CST  — Screenshots of your site and link to your site should be posted to this Assignment Page in Canvas
